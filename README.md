cortex_var in a container
=========================

This container has cortex_var and its dependencies installed, so you don't have to waste time setting it up yourself.

Note that cortex_var is still a little complicated to use, so it's worth having a good read of the manual at the [cortex homepage](http://cortexassembler.sourceforge.net/index_cortex_var.html).
